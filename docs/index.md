# SpeexDSPSharp. An unofficial .NET speexdsp wrapper.

SpeexDSPSharp is a wrapper that allows you to directly use speexdsp through C#.

### How it works

SpeexDSPSharp is an unofficial .NET wrapper for the SpeexDSP audio preprocessor. It contains managed wrappers and safe handlers as well as direct native function access to the speexdsp methods.

SpeexDSPSharp also includes prebuilt binaries available through the SpeexDSPSharp.Natives package.
